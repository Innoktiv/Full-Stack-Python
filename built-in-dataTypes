DATA TYPE
4 built-in data types in Python are used to store collections of data
List, Tuple, Dictionary, and Set, all with different qualities and usage.


LISTS
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Lists are created using square brackets:	

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]


TUPLES
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")


S	Sets
are ETS used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

DICTIONARIES
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

mydict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
